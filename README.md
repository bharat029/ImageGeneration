➔ This project aims at developing a model based on Deep Learning Concepts to create an
efficient type of autoencoder (a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data
codings) for image generation.This project aims at trying different neural networks.


➔ The working of this project is as follows:
1. First, an image is encoded which gives a point in the lattice space.
2. Minor deviations are added to this point to produce a similar encoding.
3. This modified encoding is decoded to produce a image similar to the input one.


➔ The modules involved are as listed below:
1. Preprocessing
2. Training
3. Testing/Demo


➔ Tools and Technologies

1. Python and associated Deep Learning Libraries
2. DataSet (Open Source): Fashion-MNIST
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of
60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale
image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
